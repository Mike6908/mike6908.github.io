<h1><b><center> The Importance of Miscegenation </center> </b> </h1>

<img src="https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1383333/original.jpg" alt="Renditioning of Human Race in the Future" width="400" height="500">
<p style="font-size:20px"> Humanity unfortunately continues to hold a notion that we are all defined based on our race or gender. That somehow if you're white, black, Asian, Desi whatever it may be, that you
somehow are beholden to a certain set of characteristics either mentally or physically. This idea that we are all exremely different from each other based on race is simply idiotic. The fact of the matter is that we are all human and born equal
, yes there are differences among cultures but as the world becomes more global, and even right now there's little difference between how people are at their baseline from race to race. We all have issues and we all have beautiful aspects about us.
The problem comes in when we start generalizing a persons characteristics based on their race rather than them as a human being. The reality is we really arent that different,individually yes we all have different personalities and like different things, but
as a human race, we're pretty much, well, all human. The more people you meet from different backgrounds, cultures, and races the more you realize how similar we all truly are. Now, this brings me to a potential solution to the problem, miscegenation, or the intermixing of races. See if there were one human race, one skin color, imagine how many issues would be avoided, and the harmony that would exist in the world.
As we walk by each other on a daily basis, sometimes our judgemental nature calls on us to see people based on our perceived stereotypes of them. If there were one homogenous race of humans, there would be no logical path to have preconceived notions of someone based on appearance as we would all be of the same skin color.
To demonstrate this allow me to present a toy paradigm. Lets say a farmer in Indiana walks into a corner store and sees a woman with a hijab on and non-white skin color. This man who has been raised in ignorance of other cultures his whole life may have some less-than positive thoughts about this most likely wonderful woman. This is all
 based on his perception of Muslim people or people with colored skin. Now if this same person lived in a homogenous race society where we all had the same skin color, yes he could judge her based on religion(which is another issue in itself), but he would have no reason to judge her based on her skin color, IT'S THE SAME AS HIS! Imagine all the problems we have today,
 White racism towards blacks, black racism towards whites, Indian racism toward Pakistanis and vice versa, as well as all the many racial clashes I haven't mentioned. These would simply be irrelavant or unbelievably trivial in a world where we all were part of one race. There simply would be no motivation to have racial judgements.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px"> This all may be theoretical, yes, but I really think as a thought experiment it uncovers a certain truth that we are all really similar at our core regardless of race or ethnicicity. Alright, well how feasible is any of this anyways. Many
  would say this will never ever happen, and for all I know they could be right. But consider this, all biological lifeforms move towards miscegenation as an underlying survival strategy. Biodiversity is the key to survival and has been for the history of life on Earth.
   It may simply end up as a result of an exponentially increasing global world. Already some of this is occurring today, how many half-white half-black individuals were there in the 18th or 19th century, not many. As with all of evolutionary processes, they start out slow and pick up pace rapidly at some point, which clearly hasn't come yet. Consider the world of science fiction,
    where in movies like Star Wars and Star Trek, the alien races are generally homogenous in appearance. This may be a result of long run evolution which humanity simply has not reached at this moment. There are obvious barriers to this including the fact that many people are still tribal and stick to their own race when it comes to dating and marriage. There are still arranged marriages in various parts of the world, as well as pressure from parents to marry someone who would fit in with the family culture etc. This all results in barriers to miscegenation and increasing biodiversity. These things will perhaps break down as the world becomes more global and inter-racial interaction increases. This may take many many generations but I truly believe that as we approach homogeneity, a large fraction of our trivial racially motivated problems will be eradicated. Maybe at that point we can stop being so spiteful and focus on real issues to continue the survival and expansion of the human race. Only time will tell :) </p>
