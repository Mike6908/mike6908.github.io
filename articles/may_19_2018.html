<h1><b><center> Why Are So Many Young Brilliant Engineering Students Single? </center> </b> </h1>

<p style="font-size:20px"> Ah relationships in college, for most students in Engineering or Medicine, they don't seem to be too appealing. While at University, most people are working towards something
more e.g a career or a business venture. College simply represents a stepping stone to their "true" life in the "real world" as they work towards
a chance at having a stable source of income. It makes sense a priori that there would be little interest in a relationship from most as it may
be seen as a "distraction" to their goals and dreams and basically a waste of time. A natural consequence of this is a culture of solitude in college within the engineering community
There's a pervasive sense of shyness that surrounds students of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical... you name it - they tend to be unsuccessful talking to the other gender. These students are some of
the brightest young minds in the country, great at solving problems, and yet they continuously fail at finding a romantic connection with someone. Why is this the case? I know plenty of handsome, smart,
kind and respectful young men that can't find a date for the life of them. Through my own experience and failures, it leads one to question the nature of attraction and
the existence of love. This stems from many young engineers growing up as smart students that tend to be introverted or timid when it comes to social interaction.
Weve always been better at solving problems than talking to other people it seems. For many smart young students, we end up living in perpetual loneliness with no hope of
landing a relationship any time soon. Now, this may sound like some incel rant but I assure you this is simply an empirical observation. For most we can blame it on ourselves;
we simply are too shy to talk to women or even if we get a chance, we somehow mess it up via awkwardness or simple inability to communicate in a friendly honest way(were just too nervous).
Sometimes you just don't have a connection with someone that you thought you would. For me, this past semester it became obvious this was reality.
I met a young student who was absolutely brilliant, she had everything you could ask for in a girl. She was smart, kind, respectful, with actual goals and concern for others.
Alas, it became quickly apparent that traits and values may line up perfectly, but without a true connection of the soul and mind, there is simply no chance. In this situation,
it's just impossible to relate to the other person and conversations seem forced and have a peculiar deadness to them. Frankly, if two people don't have a connection that transcends logic and
reasoning the relationship becomes more of a business transaction than a loving relationship. Now, back to the issue of young men in university stuggling to get a girl,
this may be part of the problem. How can you relate to a random girl if you can barely relate to 70% of society. You already have a 30% chance of hitting that oh-so-important mental conncection.
Many of us are so called "nerds" or "losers". We watch anime and play video games etc. which is a fair explanation of our communication struggles and idealism. We often view women in the light that they
are somehow going to be perfect beings and solve all our problems like the women in the movies. This is actually very sad and sets a standard that girls aren't regular people with the same problems men have.
The question remains though, how can such interesting, intelligent, caring guys be so out-of-demand within universities? Why are women not dying for the opportunity to date these guys and have a relationship with high
growth potential as potential marriage partners. It flat out amazes me when these charming genius engineer guys tell me that they're single and haven't ever been in a relationship... HOW does this happen?
Meanwhile the brads and chads of Alpha Beta Apple Pie are getting any girls within a 10 foot radius(this isn't fair to women but you get the point). What's the secret trick? Are engineering guys just flat out boring and
undesireable? Do women not like intelligent and nice guys? I think that is clearly not the issue. Theres a lot of blame to be put on the guys, we simply may not have the skills or comfidence that are important in courting a female. I'd like to touch on a notion that goes around that
smart engineering guys are just "too nice" or "too respectful" and that women don't care for guys like that. I think that's a ridiculous thing to say that an entire gender of people don't value kindness in a potential partner. I think this is a classic
example of correlation vs causation, where nice guys tend to have less confidence or "game" which in the end leads to either failure to communicate their feelings of attraction or just sticks them in the friend zone for eternity. Flat out some of us just arent lucky,
and we just dont come across people who we have a connection with until we're in our mid 20s at earliest in the workplace. The problem with this is that some of us
care about being young and in love but simply get rejected at every turn, and it's on us to fix ourselves but with each passing year time ticks away. It's hard to predict when life will bring a person into your life that you truly care for.
So does love exist? I'm optimistic that it does, but for many young smart students, it seems like something only found in a fairy tale. Hopefully we can all do a little bit better at communication and setting more rational expectations for our potential partners. Accepting others
 and trying to understand them through love rather than disdain is key. In the end nobody can truly be happy alone, and many of us in engineering are stuck being alone for many factors, it's amazing that the depression rates aren't sky high for us. In any event, we have a lot to learn, cheers </p>
